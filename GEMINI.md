# Gemini Agent Context

**Primary Directive:**
For all project-specific context, architecture, commands, and code style conventions, **YOU MUST READ AND FOLLOW `CLAUDE.md`**.

`CLAUDE.md` is the single source of truth for this project.

## Agent-Specific Notes
- **File Operations**: Respect `.geminiignore` to avoid reading large binary assets or generated outputs.
- **Testing**: When asked to verify changes, prefer the commands listed in `CLAUDE.md`.
